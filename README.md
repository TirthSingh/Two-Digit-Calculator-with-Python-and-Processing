# Two-Digit-Calculator-with-Python-and-Processing

A simple calculator app that enables two-digit arithmetic operations between two integers via a Python server and a Processing-based GUI. This project provides an interactive calculator that communicates with a Python backend to compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using sockets for real-time server-client data exchange.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two integers.
- **Server-Client Communication**: Built using Python and Processing, enabling real-time communication over sockets.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Processing-based GUI with easy-to-use input fields and buttons.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for invalid inputs and prevents division by zero errors.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.x
- **Processing IDE** 3.5+ 
- **Socket Library** (Built into Python standard libraries)
